## Build an image from source

**Docker images are not official ASF releases but provided for convenience. Recommended usage is always to build the source.**

1. install release version (Apache releases are beginning from version 0.9):
```
# Assign Apache release version number to variable `APISIX_VERSION`, for example: 3.0.0. The latest version can be find at `https://github.com/apache/apisix/releases`

export APISIX_VERSION=3.0.0
make build-on-debian
```

2. install master branch version, which has latest code(ONLY for the developer's convenience):
```
export APISIX_VERSION=master
make build-on-debian
```
